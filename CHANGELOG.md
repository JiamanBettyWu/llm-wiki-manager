# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **`AGENTS.md` is now the schema filename; `CLAUDE.md` becomes a stub that imports it.** `AGENTS.md` is the vendor-neutral name coding agents converge on, so Claude Code, Codex and others read one file instead of each re-rendering the schema under its own name. `init_wiki.py` writes `AGENTS.md` plus a `CLAUDE.md` containing an `@AGENTS.md` import line.
- `assets/templates/wiki-CLAUDE.md.tmpl` renamed to `wiki-AGENTS.md.tmpl` (`init_wiki.py` falls back to the old name if only that is present).

### Added
- Lint check **"Two schema files"** (quality tier): fires when `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` both exist and `CLAUDE.md` does not import `AGENTS.md` — i.e. two schemas that will drift apart.

### Backward compatibility
- **Existing `CLAUDE.md`-only wikis are unaffected.** `lint_wiki.py` and `migrate_wiki.py` prefer `AGENTS.md` and fall back to `CLAUDE.md` for reading and for the `schema_version` stamp; `init_wiki.py` will not drop an `AGENTS.md` beside a real `CLAUDE.md` schema.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- `scripts/migrate_wiki.py` — schema upgrade tool (v1 → v2): deduplicates `index.md`, moves dated changelog blocks from `hot.md` into `log.md`, stamps `schema_version` in the wiki's `CLAUDE.md`. Dry-run by default, applies with `--apply`. Idempotent.
- `references/migrate-workflow.md` — full migrate workflow documentation.
- Lint expansion: broken-link detection for markdown and `[[wiki-link]]` formats, duplicate index entries, hot.md bloat, tag hygiene (single-use tags, over-tagged pages), ambiguous wiki-link slugs, log gaps, and schema-version drift.
- Schema version check (Step 0) in every operating mode — offers migration when the wiki is behind the expected schema.

### Changed
- Template revisions for clearer `hot.md` structure (changelog history now lives in `log.md`).
- Lint thresholds configurable via `--stub-words`, `--log-gap-days`, `--hot-max-words`, `--max-tags`.

### Fixed
- README counts corrected (5 scripts, 11 reference docs); `migrate_wiki.py` added to the script table in both READMEs.
- `lint_wiki.py`: script directory is put on `sys.path` so the `migrate_wiki` import works when invoked from any cwd; frontmatter parser exception handling narrowed.
- `migrate_wiki.py`: the `hot.md` → `log.md` move now verifies the full block content on disk before deleting from `hot.md`.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Turkish README (`README.tr.md`).

### Changed
- Restructured main `README.md`.
- Removed outdated related-projects section from README.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- CI: auto-release workflow on SKILL.md version bump (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- `hot.md` hot cache — most recently ingested sources and active references.
- Obsidian wiki-link (`[[...]]`) support in lint and index handling.

### Changed
- Script improvements: flexible log/index path detection in both `wiki/` and root layouts.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Multi-wiki routing with safeguards — routes writes between a project wiki and a global wiki via the `External Wiki:` declaration in the project `CLAUDE.md`.
- `references/multi-wiki-routing.md` with four canonical scenarios.
- Discoverability improvements (release badge, installation instructions).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-07

### Added
- Initial release: Bootstrap, Ingest, Query, Update, Lint, Schema-evolve, and Teach modes.
- Scripts: `init_wiki.py`, `append_log.py`, `update_index.py`, `lint_wiki.py` (Python stdlib only, idempotent).
- 8 page templates and core reference documentation.
